Python implementation and visualization of test functions for optimization.

### Optimization Difficulty
- Hoki and Kaneko (2014) consider Optimization Difficulty in 5 broad Types.
- [Large-Scale Optimization for Evaluation Functions with Minimax Search (Hoki and Kaneko, 2014)](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10871)


### Optimization type
    - S : Single-objective optimization
    - M : Multi-objective optimization
    - C : Constrained optimization
